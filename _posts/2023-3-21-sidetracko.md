# The review.

This restaurant exclusively serves Minangnese cuisine, so you should expect some very spicy foods that are cooked with lots of coconut milk which are natively called “Santan”.
This can unfortunately deter some diners who’ve had a past history of cholesterol.
Where is the restaurant located though?

Well, the restaurant is located in downtown Semarang, specifically on Pemuda road near the Paragon mall and right next to a bank office owned by BCA.
It is very new so it isn’t really crowded, in fact, it’s the opposite of crowded, the parking lot was almost empty except for my car and one other car next to me.

When you first enter the restaurant, the infrastructure seems to be very well-equipped. I got out of my car and I was greeted by a sink with soap to wash my dirty hands with.
Although I was a bit confused by the fact that, they have an entirely cut-off section of the restaurant that is designed with the sole purpose of taking the food that was available there, which is a bit different from the normal takeout routine of Padang restaurants and more similar to the regional Prasmanan style of take out food.

There is something that I always expect in a very complete Padang restaurant though. It was either the Martabak Mesir or the legendary S-tier dish that is Sate Padang because it is my absolute favorite dish, I am a bit picky about the variations of the food though. In particular, I always favor the Pariaman variation of Sate Padang which is a lot spicier and packs a lot more punch than your average Padang Panjang Sate Padang. 

Fortunate thing is, THEY DO serve the Pariaman variation which made me very elated.

For the main course, I took some Ayam Kremes. I requested some side flakes, but they said they had run out of them. I kinda doubted them though because I didn’t think they have too many customers, and the probability of everyone who ever dined in that restaurant hoarding the side flakes is pretty low to me.

After that, I also requested some Sate Padang and the waiter immediately went to the Sate station to cook it for me. 
I went to the dining room, and it was pretty different from your usual Padang restaurants. 
They do have the normal dining table, but they also have the tall dining tables with tall chairs and it was one really long table which kind of reminds me of the dining layout of Japanese restaurants, the kitchen is literally in front of you and you also have to share a table with fellow diners.

The Ayam Kremes were pretty lip-smacking good with the right amount of salt, although it seems like it was the usual standard of Padang restaurant foods and didn’t surpass it.
Of course, in any kind of authentic Indonesian restaurant, they had to serve iced tea, and they did so I requested some iced tea and it shortly came.

The Sate Padang came a bit longer though, but you can’t always rush goodness. 
There was basically no one around in the restaurant, save for one other family. 

“THUMPP THUMPP” the waiter had come to our dining table and the Sate Padang,

IT LOOKED PERFECT. TRUST ME.

Shiny and golden brown. It had looked like the Pariaman variation so I expected it to be pretty hot and spicy, although I was quickly overwhelmed when I ate my first skewer of Sate Padang.
It was HELL-RAISING-MORE-THAN-NUCLEAR-BOMB-LEVEL-SCOVILLE-RATING-HOT, my tongue probably exploded its blood vessels because of how hot it was. It had the right blend of spices though and I wanted more and more.
I swiftly grabbed my iced tea for some much need bliss.

Before I ordered my Sate Padang, I also requested for some rice cakes (Lontong), but I didn’t finish it because I felt very bloated after drinking a city reservoir’s worth of water to cool down the London Fire of 1666 that was in my stomach.

NEXT UP! Infrastructure.

I don’t mean to be very picky, but I would like to review the infrastructure of the restaurant as well, after all this IS a review of the whole restaurant and not just their food (you silly).
The prayer room was pretty small but it was really cool. Comfortable to the point that I wanted to sleep in their prayer room.

The toilets were kind of goofy. 
The (other) sink for washing your hand was right in front of the women’s toilet but it looked like it had some construction work done inside them, so it had a lot of construction noises inside it, like drills, hammers, etc.

My brother and I joked about the fact that it seems like the room had been spiritually possessed or something. The men’s toilets were pretty well maintained and clean, after all, they didn’t have too many customers and the restaurant was pretty damn new.

So should I recommend you to dine at this restaurant? HELL YEAH. The food there is pretty good (you can’t possibly beat a Minangnese person at a food contest) and the infrastructure was pretty well maintained. If you wanted to know the actual address of the restaurant it’s at “Jl. Pemuda, Kembangsari, Kec. Semarang Tengah, Kota Semarang, Jawa Tengah 50133”, I’m not linking you to its Google Maps, go do it yourself silly.
